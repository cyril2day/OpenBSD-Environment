# Outline of files

#### I. home `/home/{user}/ | $HOME`

Rename files to prepend a _dot_ `.` at the beginning of each file; should be hidden afterwards.

#### II. home_dot_config `/home/{user}/.config/ | $HOME/.config/`

Configuration files for user applications are stored in `.config` folder within `$HOME`.
Various applications require sub-folders in `.config` and are not necessarily hidden.
